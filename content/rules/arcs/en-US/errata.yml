    Edited to: "Some cards say they hold resources. These resources can be spent and add to ambitions, **but they cannot be stolen in battle unless explicitly allowed.** If a card holding resources is stolen, the resources on the card stay on it. If it is buried, discarded, **or scrapped,** the resources on it return to the supply."

    *This clarifies some card interactions with raiding, Blighted Reach cards, and with cards like Silver-Tongues. Yes, you can steal resources off cards with Silver-Tongues!*
