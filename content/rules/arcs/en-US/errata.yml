    Edited to: "Some cards say they hold resources. These resources can be spent and add to ambitions, **but they cannot be stolen in battle unless explicitly allowed.** If a card holding resources is stolen, the resources on the card stay on it. If it is buried, discarded, **or scrapped,** the resources on it return to the supply."

    *(NOT YET IN PRINT) This clarifies some card interactions with raiding, Blighted Reach cards, and with cards like Silver-Tongues. Yes, you can steal resources off cards with Silver-Tongues!*

    These rules have been expanded to allow more card types than lore to interact with Flagships in the same way. For example, this allows edicts like [Policy of Escalation](https://cards.ledergames.com/card/ARCS-AID05) to interact with Flagships.

    This rule now explicitly states, rather than implies, that cards like [Command Chaos](https://cards.ledergames.com/card/ARCS-F713) can remove Imperial Officers, even though it’s protected, because it states it by name.

    Added "If it flips while tucked under a card, return it to the Court."<br>
    *After some soul-searching, we have reversed the previous behavior of the
    Council. This means cards like [Council Intrigue](https://cards.ledergames.com/card/ARCS-CC12)
    can flip the Council while it’s tucked under a card in the card play area, returning it to
    the Court. This means the Council won't resolve at the end of the round!*
