- q: Which planets on cluster borders are adjacent or not to each other?
  a: The planets on the borders of clusters 5 and 6 as well as the planets bordering clusters 2 and 3 are adjacent, unlike the other clusters with irregular borders.
  rules:
    - '4.3.2.2'

- q: Do I resolve hits simultaneously and then Provoke Outrage, or do I resolve them one by one?
  a: Resolve all of your hits, then Provoke Outrage. In the campaign, resolve all hits first before resolving effects that trigger from **harm**.
  rules:
    - '7.7.1'

- q: Can I Cede Control while I am a Flagship?
  a: Yes, you can Cede Control of buildings on the map, but not buildings on your Flagship.
  rules:
    - '17.2.1.1'

- q: If I have more than two resource slots open, can I put my starting resources in different slots?
  a: No. They always go in your two leftmost slots.
  rules:
    - '3.1.2.4'

- q: What does 'resources I have' mean?
  a: >
    This counts all of the resources in your play area. This includes the Imperial Trust in the Blighted Reach Expansion, 
    resource supplies on Monopoly cards in the Blighted Reach Expansion, and other cards that hold resources, even if they 
    are frozen.  This means they count towards ambitions, count towards Monopoly calculations in the Blighted 
    Reach Expansion, and apply to cards like Keeper's Solidarity and Skirmishers.
  rules:
    - ''

- q: When a rule lets me use a building 'like they are Loyal,' what does this mean?
  a: >
    This is a shorthand that essentially means 'you do not need to control the buildings' and in the case of taxing 
    'you don't take a Captive.' Other cards may refer to abilities you can do with Loyal buildings, but those abilities 
    do not apply to buildings you are using 'like they are Loyal.' (i.e. You cannot use Living Structures to replace a 
    building that you are only treating like it is Loyal. This ability only applies to buildings that are actually Loyal.)
  rules:
    - '23.1.15'

- q: Do I have to use all the pips on my action card?
  a: Nope! For example, if you have 3 action pips, you could take only 1 action.
  rules:
    - '5.'

- q: If I convert a standard action into a new action, do modifiers of the standard action apply?
  a: >
    Nope! Action modifiers only change the listed standard action. However, if a new action __contains__ a standard action, 
    then modifiers of that standard action apply, unless explicitly ignored (e.g., Force Beams).
  rules:
    - '8.2'

- q: When a card says 'when you Copy or Pivot to' do a specific action, what triggers this?
  a: >
    Only spending the card pip to Copy or Pivot for that action. It does not trigger from Prelude actions.<br>
    An ability that says “When you Copy or Pivot to battle” does trigger if you spent a Weapon to let you battle from your 
    Copy or Pivot action pip.<br>
    You can trigger the ability if you Copy or Pivot to use a new action containing the listed standard action. For example, 
    the Nurture action on Living Structures contains the Tax action, so if you took the Nurture action with a Copy or Pivot, 
    it would trigger an ability that says “If you Copy or Pivot to tax…”
  rules:
    - '5.2.2'

- q: Can I tax a city even if there are no resources of its type to tax?
  a: Yes. For example, you could still gain a Captive by taxing a Rival city in this way.
  rules:
    - '7.1'

- q: If I choose to collect fewer dice than the maximum, are those ships still 'in the battle' and can they take hits?
  a: Yes. All your Loyal ships are attacking ships and can take hits from self-hits and intercepts.
  rules:
    - '7.7.1.3'

- q: Can I attempt to battle somewhere even without a legal defender?
  a: No.
  rules:
    - '7.7'

- q: Can I attempt to secure a card even without a legal target?
  a: No.
  rules:
    - '7.6'

- q: When exactly do I need to stop with a Catapult move
  a: > 
    When you reach a planet (regardless of control) or a gate that is controlled 
    by a Rival (counted just before your ships move in). As long as you have not 
    stopped, you may backtrack while dropping off ships. For example, you could 
    Catapult from a planet in cluster 3, drop ships off in gate 3, then in gate 4, 
    then finally stop at a planet in cluster 3.
  rules:
    - '7.3.2'

- q: Can you lay out the turn structure in fine detail?
  a: > 
    Here is the turn structure:<br>
    1. Play an action card.<br>
    2. If you’re leading, you may declare an ambition. If you’re not leading, you may seize the initiative.<br>
    3. Prelude window begins. You may use the Prelude actions of cards and resources.<br>
    4. Prelude window ends. Return spent resources to the supply.<br>
    5. Perform actions by spending action pips from your played card.<br><br>
    In theory, once you spend an action pip from the played action card, you cannot use any more Prelude actions. 
    In practice, as long as your actions do not reveal new information (e.g., battle/secure), it is fine to rewind 
    to the Prelude.
  rules:
    - '5.'

- q: In my Prelude, can I regain a resource that I spent in my Prelude? 
  a: No. Reesources only return to their supplies at the end of Prelude.
  rules:
    - '9.1'

- q: Can I use *non*-Prelude actions on cards that I secured from the Court during my current Prelude?
  a: Yes!
  rules:
    - '8.1.2'

- q: Can I use Prelude actions on cards in the same Prelude I gained them if I took them from places other than the Court?
  a: Yes! For example, if you stole a card using Silver-Tongues, you could immediately use it.
  rules:
    - '8.1.2'

- q: Is seizing mandatory if I Surpass with a '7' card?
  a: Yes. As normal, though, you cannot seize the initiative if someone else already did this round.
  rules:
    - '5.2.3'

- q: Can I spend resources in my Prelude without effect?
  a: Yes, even if you have Outrage of the resource types.
  rules:
    - '9.1'

- q: Can I rearrange resources when I lose a resource?
  a: No, only when gaining.
  rules:
    - '9.2.1'

- q: When I spend a resource for an action, can I also spend a Weapon to change this action to battle?
  a: No. Weapons only let you modify actions you take from your action card pips.
  rules:
    - '9.1'

- q: To be clear, does Provoking Outrage discard anything I take from Ransacking the Court or raiding in the same battle?
  a: Nope!
  rules:
    - '7.7.4'
