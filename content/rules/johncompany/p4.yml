    - name: Prestige and Blackmail Cards
      text: >
        Prestige cards (20) and blackmail cards (10) are usually won in the London Season and grant

    - name: Law Cards
      text: >
        Law cards (26) are used by the Prime Minister player during the Parliament Meets phase. These
        cards can change the fundamental rules of the game or present challenges which the players
        must all face together. If a law is passed, it is placed faceup near the board and the
        remainder are kept in a stack near the Prime Minister. One law card, the Deregulation card
        (with Debtor's Prison on back), is used only in certain scenarios.

    - name: Company Failure Cards
      text: >
        John Company ends either with the success of the Company or its failure. When the Company is
        successful, players will compete in one final retirement, where they may score additional
        points. If the Company fails, a random Company failure card (6) is drawn to determine whom
        the fickle public will blame for this disaster. Most failure cards inflict some sort of
        scoring penalty.

    - name: Setup Cards and Scenario Cards

      text: >
        There are 22 player-owned ships. These ships are placed on shipyards when unfitted and then
        placed on the map or on firms when fitted. If fatigued, they are turned to their fatigued
        side. There are also 14 other ships used by the Company. On one side, they are extra ships,
        which are under short-term leases and will only trade for a single turn before returning to
        the supply. On the other side, they are Company ships that are built and maintained by the
        Company.

    - name: Prime Minister
      text: >
        One player will always be the Prime Minister and keeps the Prime Minister dial in their play

    - name: Office Overlays
      text: >
        There are 8 different Governor overlays, which are added to the map if a region becomes
        Company-controlled. The family member serving as Governor is placed on top of the overlay. In
        addition, there is one Superintendent of Trade in China overlay used to hold both the family
        member in that position and any ships assigned to Trade in China. There is also one Governor
        General overlay which is placed on the ribbon if that office is in play.

            The 1710 Scenario should be played first.

        - name: 1758 Scenario
          text: >
            The 1758 Scenario is recommended for those who have played the 1710 scenario a couple
            times. Here, the Company begins with its monopoly, but this can be broken, opening the
            gates of India to private firms.

        - name: 1813 Scenario
          text: >
            The 1813 Scenario is the most advanced scenario. In it, the Company starts without its
            monopoly, and players may start private trading firms. This scenario is best with 5 or 6
            players.

        - name: Long 1710 Scenario
          text: >
            The Long 1710 Scenario is intended for players who have the time to play through the full
            history of the Company. This scenario begins identically to the 1710 scenario, but it
            gives players the tools of Deregulation. This scenario may go up to 8 turns and often
            takes twice as long as the other scenarios.

    - name: Scenario Setup
      text: >
        After choosing a scenario, take the matching scenario setup card. Follow any instructions on
        the front of the card, taking components as needed and using pawns to mark the listed
        position on various tracks. Then, set up the regions of India as shown on the card. Place a
        black pawn on the space with the matching date on the Turn track, and the arm on the Prime
        Minister dial to point to the matching date.

        - name: Dealing Cards
          text: >
            Next, deal out the setup cards evenly among the players. Each player should take
            everything listed on their setup cards. For each office listed, place a family member on
            the listed office space and take the matching office card. For cash listed, take that
            amount from the bank.

        - name: Complete Setup

            Then, complete setup:<br>
            \- Set any remaining office cards near the board.<br>
            \- Build the London Season Display. Shuffle the prestige cards and blackmail cards
            together and deal three. Prestige cards should be placed faceup, blackmail cards should
            be placed facedown.<br>
            \- Shuffle the remaining law cards and place them near the board.

    - name: Draft Variant
      text: >
        Instead of drawing random setup cards, players may wish to draft starting positions using the
        following procedure. After setup cards are dealt, each player selects one and then passes the
        remainder to the player to their left. Continue doing this until no cards remain.

        Most components in John Company are limited by the pieces included. If a supply of pieces is
        empty, complete as much of the action as possible. However, players may use proxies if they
        run out of cash, trophy/passed law tokens, dice, and regiments. The Company Balance, Victory
        Point, and Vote tracks have no limit.

    - name: Your Play Area and Hidden Information
      text: >
        Players maintain a play area that contains everything they own. All information (including
        the contents of discard piles) is public except facedown blackmail cards.

    - name: Cash Flow
      text: >
        In John Company, cash always has a location, and its location determines how it can be spent,
        traded, or paid. You can spend cash in your family treasury on various family actions,
        retirements, upkeep, taxes, and negotiations. Cash within a Company office can only be spent
        by that office.

    - name: The Presidencies
      text: >
        The British East India Company divided India into three administrative zones called
        Presidencies which are each named after their home region. In John Company, these
        Presidencies are special offices that maintain their own Army, cadre of writers, fleet of
        ships, and—later in the game—subordinate offices. These resources are stored in their marked
        boxes or in the zone of the Indian Ocean near their office box on the map.

    - name: The Map of India and How to Read It
      pretext: >
        Though much of the action of John Company occurs outside of India, players will frequently
        refer to and use the map of India.

      children:
        - name: Regions
          text: >
            The map is divided into eight regions, each roughly corresponding to a different
            political and commercial trade center.

        - name: Region Strength
          text: >
            Every region has strength, usually represented by its tower. The number of levels in the
            tower dictates the strength of the region (the dome does not count as a tower level).
            This number is used to determine a region's attack and defense value.

        - name: Orders
          text: >
            Within each region are a number of connected circles called orders. Each order contains a
            number that indicates the value of that order and is connected to other orders with a
            dotted line. Orders represent economic opportunities for the players.

        - name: Home Ports
          text: >
            Orders with a heavy black outline are called home ports. Players use these orders to
            access other orders deeper in India.

        - name: Closed Orders
          text: >
            If an order is closed, cover it with a closed order token. This represents trade
            disruptions or anti-Company sentiment.

        - name: Political Alignment
          text: >
            Every region has a political alignment: either sovereign or dominated. Sovereign regions
            (those with a large flag or a dome without any flag) will attempt to invade their
            neighbors. Dominated regions (those with a small flag or no dome) will attempt to rebel
            to regain their sovereignty.

          text: >
            When a region conquers another region, it either forms an empire or expands its existing
            empire. All empires are composed of one capital region (marked by a flag with a star) and
            at least one dominated region (marked by a smaller version of that flag). Empires combine
            the strengths of their regions when attacking and defending in many situations, as
            described later in the rules.

        - name: Empire Decline
          text: >

      pretext: >
        India is always faced with a looming Crisis. This is represented by the Elephant and its

            If the Elephant is in the center of a region or facing the region that dominates it, the
            acting region is getting ready to rebel against its sovereign.

    - name: Negotiation
      pretext: >
        John Company is a negotiation game. Players can transfer a wide range of assets to one
        another. This includes: enterprises, facedown blackmail cards, cash in your family's
        treasury, shares, and promise cards. You cannot transfer officeholders, writers, officers,
        pieces on prizes, spouses, passed laws, played blackmail cards, Prime Minister dial, or
        trophies.

      children:
        - name: Promise Cards
          text: >
            Each player has a set of five promise cards they may give other players as part of a
            negotiation. You may "call in" a promise card and force the player who guaranteed the
            promise to fulfill the promise if they can. Critically, you cannot "call in" a promise
            card once the game is over and players are resolving Final Scoring. If multiple players
            call in a promise at the same time, the player who guaranteed them chooses which to
            fulfill if they cannot fulfill all of them. All promise cards contain details of their
            use on their back sides.

        - name: Transfer Rules
          text: >
            When transferring resources there is one golden rule: something transferred cannot
            activate twice. For instance, during the Bonuses phase, Cati collects £1 for her
            workshop's profits. If she sells her workshop at this time to another player, it will not
            generate £1 again this round. Negotiations involving immediate transfers are binding. All
            other negotiations are non-binding.

        - name: Enterprises and Blackmail Cards
          text: >
            You may trade any enterprise card. You may allow others to peek at your facedown
            blackmail cards and trade them, but they cannot be traded faceup. Remember to adjust the
            victory point total if transferring luxuries.

            Each enterprise (remember: some prestige cards are enterprises) or Company share is worth

            The players with the most and second most power gain victory points depending on which
            turn was the final game turn, as indicated by the table on the board. If players are tied
            for the most power, award the lower value to the tied players only, and no other power
            award is given. Players tied for second place get nothing.

    - name: Score Court and Workshops
      text: >
        If the Company survived, each Company share is worth the number of victory points indicated

            Roll one die for each office card you hold. Each fatigue on a card adds +1 to the result

            \- **1 or 2:** Nothing happens.<br>
            \- **3 or 4:** Add a fatigue to the office card.<br>
            \- **5 or more:** That officeholder retires. Move the family member holding that office
            to the Pensioners box on the board. Then, flip the office card to its vacant side and
            place it in the Vacant Offices box nearby. Any fatigue that was on the office card should
            be returned to the supply.

    - name: Retirements
      text: >
        Starting with the Chairman (or former Chairman if the office is vacant) and going clockwise,
        each player may retire their pensioner(s). For each pensioner, choose a prize on the left
        side of the board, pay the cost indicated on the top left of the prize box, and move your
        pensioner to that box. Increase your victory point marker by the amount listed.<br><br>
        Note: most prizes also have an upkeep value listed to the right of their cost which must be
        paid during the Upkeep and Refresh phase. In addition, many prizes also have window tax
        icons, which may need to be paid for during the Parliament Meets phase.<br><br>
        Instead of paying the cost of your retirements directly to the bank, set it near your player
        area. It will be used to determine turn order in the next step and should be paid to the bank
        at the end of the London Season.

    - name: Prestige Cards
      pretext: >
        Beginning with the player who spent the most total cash on retirements this turn, each player
        who retired at least one pensioner this turn must take or discard one card from the London
        Season Display. Any ties are broken in favor of most total window icons (including from
        retirements this turn!) and then in Prime Minister order (clockwise, starting with the Prime
        Minister).

            Spouses usually increase your family's victory points, but most come with a restriction
            you must follow for the rest of the game. Spouses cannot be transferred. If a restriction
            requires you to discard or trade enterprises/shares, players must negotiate any trades
            immediately after they take the spouse.<br><br>
            Most spouses also have a retirement discount that lowers the cost of a retirement by the
            amount shown. These discounts can be stacked, but may only be used by you alone. Each
            discount may be used once per London Season and once per Final Scoring. Note: these
            discounts will lower the amount you spend in retirement, which can influence the order in
            which prestige cards are taken.

        - name: Enterprises
          text: >
            Enterprises on prestige cards offer special powers which a player may use. These
            enterprises may be worth power during Final Scoring like other enterprises of their type
            and are likewise affected by policies during the Parliament Meets phase. These
            enterprises can be transferred.

        - name: Blackmails
          text: >
            Blackmails offer one-time effects. After they are used they are placed in your player
            area faceup and cannot be transferred. At the end of the game, all blackmail cards in a
            player's area (faceup or down) count for power during Final Scoring.

    This phase has two steps. First, all players will take their family action. Then, new Company

      pretext: >
        Starting with the player with the Chairman title and proceeding clockwise, each player
        selects one family action from those listed in this section and places their opportunity
        marker on the action they choose. (Note: at the start of the game, this marker is not on any
        action.)

          text: >
            If a player's opportunity marker was already on the action they chose at the start of
            this phase, they may take that action twice instead.

        - name: Extra Actions
          text: >
            Some laws enable players to take an additional action after they have taken their main
            action. Only the most recently-passed extra action can be used. This action does not
            benefit from a player's opportunity marker, nor does a player move their opportunity
            marker to the space corresponding to the extra action.

        - name: No Action
          text: >
            Rarely, players may be unable to take a family action. In these cases, no action is taken
            and their opportunity token should be placed in their supply of pieces. In practice this
            only happens if a player has no family pieces, prizes, or money.

            they are in your possession. Adjust your victory point marker to reflect your purchase.
            Each luxury has a window tax icon, which may need to be paid for during the Parliament
            Meets phase. Each luxury counts as a social enterprise.

            Pay £2 to the bank and take one shipyard. Place the matching ship token on the shipyard
            in the space indicated. Shipyards provide a £1 bonus each turn if their ship has been
            fitted and provide a single vote in the Parliament Meets phase. Each shipyard counts as a
            shipping enterprise.

        - name: Purchase Workshop
          text: >
            Pay £5 to the bank and take one workshop. A workshop provides a £1 bonus each turn and
            two votes in the Parliament Meets phase. If the Company fails, it is worth 1 victory
            point during Final Scoring. Each workshop counts as a manufacturing enterprise.

            Place a family member on an empty space on the Stock Exchange track above the Court of

            become shares at the end of the Family phase. Once shares, they may provide income
            through dividends and will be worth victory points at the end of the game if the Company
            survives. If the Company fails, they will cost victory points instead.

    - name: New Company Shares

        Offices are hired in ascending order using the number on the back of each office card. Vacant
        offices can only be hired by certain officeholders who choose from a specific pool of
        candidates. The hiring office and the available candidates are listed on the back of the
        office card. Once a candidate is hired, move that family member to the new office and give

            Some higher offices (like the Director of Trade) are hired from family members who
            already hold offices. Whenever a family member is promoted in this way, their previously
            held office card should be flipped over and added to the stack of vacant offices in the
            appropriate order (ascending). Any fatigue tokens on the promoted officeholder's previous
            card are moved over to the new office card.

            Any player with a Company share may attempt to become the new Chairman. To be elected the
            new Chairman you need consent from players that control a majority of the current Company
            shares.<br><br>
            At the start of the election, the former Chairman should declare the number of Company
            shares required to achieve a pure majority (more than half of total). Then, any player is
            welcome to campaign for their candidacy. As soon as a candidate has the required number
            of supporting Company shares, the election is over, and that player is chosen as the new
            Chairman.<br><br>
            The newly-elected Chairman takes the Chairman marker and moves one of their Company
            shares to the Chairman slot on the board. This piece still counts as a Company share, but
            cannot be traded in a negotiation or used for firm investments (if playing with
            Deregulation).<br><br>
            If no candidate can receive the necessary support, the former Chairman picks any player
            with at least one Company share to become the new Chairman, including themselves. This
            choice is not subject to the Nepotism rule.

            from the office's treasury and is paid to the bank.<br><br>
            When making a check, first, decide on the amount of resources you want to spend or
            exhaust, and gather the appropriate number of dice equal to the amount shown on the
            office card. Then, remove dice equal to the penalty. Finally, roll the dice. Use the
            lowest rolled value to determine one of three results:<br>
            \- **1 or 2** is a success.<br>
            \- **3 or 4** is a failure. The check may be attempted again if there are sufficient
            resources.<br>
            \- **5 or 6** is a catastrophic failure. The office will take no further actions. The
            acting officeholder is immediately returned to its player's supply, and that office card
            is flipped and placed in the Vacant Offices box. Any fatigue that was on the office card

            \- **Commission Regiment.** Place a regiment from the supply in the Army associated with
            your President. Regiments are treated as officers, but any loot they earn is paid to the
            bank and they cannot be removed through a loss check.<br>

                If you do not manage a firm and have the consent of players who collectively hold a
                majority of a firm's shares, you may initiate a hostile takeover. Flip your board to
                its firm charter side. Place your two firm cubes on the tracks in the matching spaces
                as the firm you are taking over. Move any ships, treasury funds, and shares to your
                board. The previous owner then returns their cubes to their supply and returns their
                firm charter to the family side.

                Firm managers may consolidate any number of firms into a single firm through a
                negotiated merger.<br><br>
                In a merger, the highest value firm among those merging will be the primary firm (if
                there is a tie, the players will pick from among those tied). This firm will remain
                after the merger is completed. The other firms in the merger are called secondary
                firms.<br><br>
                As part of a merger, players may negotiate for the transfer of firm shares to other
                players. If the primary firm would have more than ten shares after merger, any excess
                shares must be returned to their owner's supply with their owner's consent.<br><br>
                In order for a negotiated merger to take place, all involved firms must have the full
                consent of every shareholder. All merger negotiations are considered a single
                immediate transfer (and therefore binding).<br><br>
                After a merger is agreed to, all secondary firms transfer and consolidate their
                treasuries, shareholders, and ships into a single firm. Then, the secondary firms
                flip to their family side.

                near their player board and placing the money they wish to spend on the matching box

            At the start of a Presidency's Operations (before any actions are taken), any firm with a
            strategy that is associated with that Presidency reveals their strategy and makes a check
            with dice equal to the cash allocated to their strategy. The cash is then paid to the
            bank. If at least one success is rolled, the firm may trade. Each firm that successfully
            trades has an initiative value equal to the total of their ships minus the number of
            successful dice (1s and 2s) they rolled. This number can be negative.<br><br>
            Orders are filled after the President has made a successful roll while taking the Trade
            action. A President's roll determines their initiative like a firm and counts all ships
            in their Presidency's sea zone.

            in the associated Presidency fills as many orders as possible. Any ties in initiative are
            decided by the operating President.<br><br>
            Firms fill a number of open orders up to the number of ships they own plus one. Orders
            must be filled starting with the home port listed on their strategy. When filling an
            order, you must be able to trace a path back to this port through any number of orders
            that you have filled.<br><br>
            You may only fill each order once. When a firm first fills an order, mark it with a

            the following shareholders Blue (2 + Manager) and Yellow (2) and £8 to payout. Normally
            each dividend would pay out £5, but that doesn't allow the manager to pay out all £8. If
            Blue forgoes a share of dividends twice, all £8 could be paid out. Blue and Yellow would

    In the solo and two player game, you will be playing against the Crown. The Crown is sometimes
    keen to see the Company succeed, with them becoming the dominant power within the Company. At
    other times, the Crown seeks for the Company to fail. You must negotiate with the Crown and
    influence their decision-making to seize victory for yourself. Sometimes the Crown will make bad
    decisions for the Company and paying for costly favors may be the only way to keep those
    decisions in check. You do so via a set of 12 Crown promise cubes. There is a limited number of
    promise cubes, so you must do favors for the Crown in return to get promise cubes back.<br><br>
    The game follows all of the standard multiplayer rules, with the following adjustments:

            They will first use all of one color when placing family members.<br><br>
            Divide the 12 Crown promise cubes equally between the Crown and the human players (i.e. 6
            each in a solo game, 4 each in a 2-player game).<br><br>
            The Crown sits last in order in respect to whoever was Chairman during setup, or before
            whichever player is next in the order of offices if the Crown is themselves the Chairman.

            with 4 setup cards and the Crown finishes with 8.<br><br>
            As a variant, players can deal the setup cards randomly. Deal 4 to the soloist and 8 to

        by the finger on the current AI card.<br><br>
        Each time the Crown must decide between the two players, they will select the player holding
        the Player Button. Likewise, if there is disagreement over which of the two players gets to
        act in a certain situation (e.g. if both wish to perform the same favor with the Crown at the
        same time), the decision goes to the player holding the Player Button. In both cases, that
        player must then immediately pass the Player Button to the other player.<br><br>
        A player holding the Player Button may transfer it to the other player as part of a
        negotiation.
